2. **Select all products:**
   - Click the checkbox at the top left (selects all 3 products)

3. **Click "More actions" dropdown** (top right area)

4. **Select "Make products available"**

5. **Choose your Hydrogen storefront:**
   - Look for "Headless" or "Sacred Line Studio"
   - Check the box âœ…

6. **Click "Make available" or "Save"**

7. **Done!** All 3 products are now published to Hydrogen

### Method 2: Individual Product (If Method 1 doesn't work)

For each of your 3 products:

1. Click on the product to open it
2. Scroll down to **"Product availability"** section
3. Look for "Headless" or your Hydrogen storefront name

## After Publishing

1. **Wait 5 seconds** for Shopify to update

2. **Test the API** (run this in your terminal):
```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://stx7iu-x1.myshopify.com/api/2024-10/graphql.json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token: 82c7d1f918a145e14dede6b2d4b22da2" \
  -d '{"query":"{ products(first: 5) { nodes { id title } } }"}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

3. **You should see your 3 products listed!**

4. **Refresh your Hydrogen dev site** - Your products will appear! ðŸŽ‰

## What You'll See

Once published, your homepage will show:
- Featured collection (if you have one)
- Your 3 products in a beautiful grid
- With the Sacred Line Studio design we created
- Gold accents, elegant typography, smooth hover effects

## Troubleshooting

**If you don't see a "Headless" or "Sacred Line Studio" option:**

1. The Hydrogen channel might not be created yet
2. Go to: https://admin.shopify.com/store/stx7iu-x1/hydrogen
3. Make sure the storefront is created
4. Then try publishing again

**Still stuck?**
Let me know what options you see in the "Product availability" section!

**Do this now and let me know when done!** ðŸ‘†
