# üîç Debugging the Redirect Issue

## What's Happening

The 7-section homepage loads briefly, then redirects somewhere else.

## Possible Causes

### 1. **Shopify Navigation Prefetch**
The manifest shows it's prefetching `/collections/frontpage`:
```
GET  200  render  /__manifest?paths=%2Fcollections%2Ffrontpage
```

This is because your Shopify menu has a "Home" link to `/collections/frontpage`.

### 2. **Client-Side Navigation**
React Router might be automatically navigating due to prefetching logic.

### 3. **Shopify Admin Redirects**
Check if you have redirects set up in Shopify Admin:
- Go to: https://stx7iu-x1.myshopify.com/admin/settings/domains
- Or: https://stx7iu-x1.myshopify.com/admin/settings/general
- Look for any URL redirects

### 4. **Data Loading Error**
If the collections query fails, it might trigger an error boundary.

## Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Remove Prefetch from Navigation Menu Link

Let's check what's in your Shopify menu and temporarily disable the problematic link.

**Go to**: https://stx7iu-x1.myshopify.com/admin/menus

Find the "Home" menu item and:
- **Option A**: Delete it entirely (the header already has a home link)
- **Option B**: Change its URL from `/collections/frontpage` to `/`

### Solution 2: Test with Simple Homepage

Let's create a super simple version to test if it's a component issue.

### Solution 3: Check Browser Console

Open Browser DevTools (F12) and check:
1. **Console tab**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Network tab**: See if there's a 301/302 redirect
3. **Elements tab**: Check if the HTML is actually rendering

---

## Immediate Debug Steps

1. **Open the browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. **Go to** `http://localhost:3001/`
3. **Watch for**:
   - Any error messages
   - Console logs (we added one saying "Homepage rendering with data")
   - Network requests showing redirects

4. **Check Network tab**:
   - Look for a request to `/` 
   - Check if the status is 200 or 301/302
   - See if there's a Location header

## What to Report Back

Please check and let me know:

1. ‚úÖ Do you see "Homepage rendering with data:" in the console?
2. ‚úÖ What does the Network tab show for the `/` request?
3. ‚úÖ Are there any red errors in the console?
4. ‚úÖ Does the URL in the address bar change?
5. ‚úÖ How long do you see the 7 sections before the redirect (1 second? 5 seconds?)?

This will help us pinpoint exactly what's causing the redirect!
