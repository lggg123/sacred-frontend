# How to Connect Your Hydrogen Store to Your Production Store

## The Problem

Your Hydrogen app is currently connected to a **development store** (`stx7iu-x1.myshopify.com`) that has **no products**.

Your **actual store** with products (using Horizon theme with Printful products) is a different store.

## Solutions

### âœ… Option 1: Link to Your Production Store (RECOMMENDED)

This will connect your Hydrogen frontend to your actual store with products.

#### Steps:

1. **Unlink from current store:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .shopify
   ```

2. **Link to your production store:**
   ```bash
   npx shopify hydrogen link
   ```
   
3. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Login with your Shopify account
   - Select your production store (the one with products)
   - Choose or create a Hydrogen storefront

4. **Pull environment variables:**
   ```bash
   npx shopify hydrogen env pull
   ```

5. **Restart dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Your products will now appear!** ðŸŽ‰

### Option 2: Add Products to Current Development Store

If you want to keep using the development store, add some test products:

1. **Go to Shopify Admin:**
   - Visit: https://admin.shopify.com/store/stx7iu-x1
   - Login with your credentials

2. **Add Products:**
   - Go to **Products** â†’ **Add product**
   - Create 3-5 test products
   - Add images, prices, descriptions
   - **Important:** Make sure products are **Published** to "Online Store"

3. **Refresh Your Dev Site:**
   - The products will now appear in your Hydrogen store

### Option 3: Deploy to See Products (NOT RECOMMENDED)

You could deploy without testing, but this is risky. It's better to test locally first using Option 1 or 2.

## Which Store Do You Have Products On?

To help you connect to the right store, I need to know:

1. **What is your production store URL?**
   - Example: `your-store.myshopify.com`
   - Or your custom domain

2. **Do you want to:**
   - A) Connect Hydrogen to your production store (Option 1) âœ… **RECOMMENDED**
   - B) Add test products to the current dev store (Option 2)

## Quick Start: Connect to Production Store

If you want to connect to your production store right now, run these commands:

```bash
# Step 1: Unlink from development store
rm -rf .shopify

# Step 2: Link to your production store
npx shopify hydrogen link

# Step 3: Pull environment variables
npx shopify hydrogen env pull

# Step 4: Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

Then refresh your browser and you'll see your products! ðŸŽ‰

## Important Notes

### About Hydrogen Storefronts
- Hydrogen is a **separate storefront** from your theme-based store
- It uses the same products/data from Shopify
- But it's a custom-built frontend (what we just designed)
- Your Horizon theme store will continue to work independently

### About Development vs Production
- **Development Store**: For testing, no products
- **Production Store**: Your real store with Printful products
- You want to connect Hydrogen to your **production store**

### About Deployment
- Once connected to your production store and tested locally
- You can deploy Hydrogen to Oxygen (Shopify's hosting)
- Or deploy to Vercel, Netlify, etc.
- Your customers can use either:
  - Your Horizon theme store (existing)
  - Your new Hydrogen store (new custom design)

## What Happens When You Link to Production?

1. âœ… You'll see all your Printful products
2. âœ… Collections will work
3. âœ… Product pages will work
4. âœ… Cart/checkout will connect to your store
5. âœ… Orders will go to your Shopify admin
6. âœ… Everything will "just work"

The beautiful design system we created will display your actual products! ðŸŒŸ
