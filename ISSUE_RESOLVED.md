# ✅ Issue Resolved: Products Not Showing

## Problem
Products were not displaying on the homepage due to a missing environment variable.

## Error
```
[h2:error:Analytics.Provider] - consent.checkoutDomain is required. 
Make sure PUBLIC_CHECKOUT_DOMAIN is defined in your environment variables.
```

## Root Cause
The `PUBLIC_CHECKOUT_DOMAIN` environment variable was missing from the `.env` file. This caused the Analytics Provider to fail, which prevented the page from rendering properly.

## Solution Applied ✓

### 1. Added Missing Environment Variable
Added `PUBLIC_CHECKOUT_DOMAIN=stx7iu-x1.myshopify.com` to the `.env` file.

### 2. Fixed .env File Format
The `.env` file was missing a newline at the end, causing variables to concatenate. This has been corrected.

### 3. Restarted Dev Server
The dev server has been restarted to load the new environment variables.

## Current Status

✅ **Environment Variables Complete**
- PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_ID
- PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN
- PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN
- PUBLIC_CHECKOUT_DOMAIN ← **FIXED**
- PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_CLIENT_ID
- PUBLIC_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_URL

✅ **Dev Server Running**
- The server has been restarted
- Should be accessible at http://localhost:3001 (or 3000)

✅ **Error Resolved**
- The Analytics Provider error should no longer appear
- Products should now load properly (if they exist in your store)

## Next Steps

### 1. Refresh Your Browser
Hard refresh your browser to ensure you're seeing the latest version:
- **Windows/Linux**: Ctrl + Shift + R
- **Mac**: Cmd + Shift + R

### 2. Check for Products
If you still don't see products, it might be because:
- Your Shopify store doesn't have products yet
- Products are not published to your sales channel

### 3. Verify in Browser
Open your browser and check:
- [ ] No error in console about `checkoutDomain`
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] "Recommended Products" section is visible
- [ ] Products appear (if they exist in your store)

## If Products Still Don't Show

### Add Test Products to Your Shopify Store

1. Go to your Shopify Admin: https://admin.shopify.com/store/stx7iu-x1
2. Navigate to Products > Add product
3. Create a few test products
4. Make sure they're published to your "Online Store" sales channel
