# üéØ Quick Navigation Fix

## The Issue
Your "Home" menu button goes to `/collections/frontpage` instead of your new 7-section homepage.

## The Fix (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Test Without Fixing Menu (RIGHT NOW)
Just type this in your browser URL bar:
```
http://localhost:3001/
```
Or click on **"Sacred Line Studio"** (your store name) in the header - that ALWAYS goes to the homepage!

### Option 2: Fix the Menu (In Shopify Admin)
1. Go to: https://stx7iu-x1.myshopify.com/admin/menus
2. Click **Main menu**
3. Find the "Home" menu item
4. **Delete it** OR change its link to just `/`
5. Click **Save menu**

## ‚ö° The Confusion Explained

```
‚ùå /collections/frontpage  ‚Üí Old collection page (not your new design)
‚úÖ /                       ‚Üí New 7-section homepage (what we built!)
```

The menu is sending you to the wrong place. But the homepage IS there and ready!

---

## üîß Immediate Action

**Click on "Sacred Line Studio" (the store name) in your header right now** - that's hardcoded to go to `/` and will show you the new design!

Or just manually type `/` in your URL bar.

---

Your 7-section homepage is **live and working** - you just need to access the right URL! üöÄ
