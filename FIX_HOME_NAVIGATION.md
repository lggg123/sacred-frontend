# 🔧 Fix Home Navigation Issue

## Problem

When you click "Home" in the navigation menu, it goes to `/collections/frontpage` instead of showing the new 7-section homepage at `/`.

## Root Cause

Your Shopify Admin menu has a "Home" menu item that's configured to link to the "Frontpage Collection" instead of the homepage.

## ✅ Solution: Update Shopify Menu

### Step 1: Go to Shopify Admin Navigation
1. Log into your Shopify Admin: https://stx7iu-x1.myshopify.com/admin
2. Go to **Online Store** → **Navigation**
3. Click on your **Main menu** (or Header menu)

### Step 2: Find the "Home" Menu Item
Look for a menu item labeled "Home" or similar.

### Step 3: Update the Link
- **Option A**: Delete the "Home" menu item entirely
  - The header already has a "Home" link (the store name) that goes to `/`
  - You don't need a duplicate "Home" in the menu
  
- **Option B**: Change the "Home" link to point to `/`
  - Click on the "Home" menu item
  - Change the link from `collections/frontpage` to `/` (just a forward slash)
  - Click **Save**

### Step 4: Save Menu
Click the **Save menu** button at the top right.

## 🎯 Expected Result

After fixing the menu:
- Clicking "Home" in navigation → Shows your new 7-section homepage
- Going to the root URL `/` → Shows your new 7-section homepage
- The 7 sections are:
  1. Hero Section
  2. Brand Story
  3. Featured Collection
  4. Products Grid
  5. Values Section
  6. Collections Grid
  7. Newsletter

## 🔍 Alternative: Test Direct URL

While you fix the menu, you can test the homepage directly:

1. Go to: http://localhost:3001/
2. You should see the full 7-section design
3. If you're on `/collections/frontpage`, manually type `/` in the URL bar

## 📝 What's Happening

### Current State
```
User clicks "Home" 
  → Shopify menu says: go to /collections/frontpage
  → Shows old collection page
```

### After Fix
```
User clicks "Home"
  → Menu says: go to /
  → Shows new 7-section homepage ✅
```

## 🎨 Why This Happens

Shopify themes (like Horizon) often set "Home" to link to a special "Frontpage" collection because that's how traditional Shopify themes work. But Hydrogen uses a custom homepage route (`app/routes/_index.tsx`) which is much more flexible!

Your new homepage doesn't use the frontpage collection at all - it has its own beautiful 7-section design.

## ✅ Verification Steps

After fixing the menu:

1. Refresh your site
2. Click "Home" in the navigation
3. You should see:
   - ✨ Hero section (full screen)
   - 📖 Brand story
   - 🎨 Featured collection
   - 🛍️ Products grid
   - ✦ Values section
   - 📚 Collections grid
   - 💌 Newsletter

If you still see the old collection page, clear your browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R).

## 🚀 Quick Fix (If You Can't Access Admin)

If you can't access Shopify Admin right now, you can test the homepage by:

1. Typing this in your browser: `http://localhost:3001/`
2. Or clicking on the **store name** (Sacred Line Studio) in the header - that always goes to `/`

The issue is purely with the menu item configuration in Shopify, not with your code!

---

## 📞 Still Not Working?

If after fixing the menu you still have issues:

1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Restart the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Hard refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Your 7-section homepage is ready and working - it's just a menu configuration issue!** 🎉
