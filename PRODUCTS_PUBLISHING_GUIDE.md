# Products Not Showing - Diagnostic Guide

## Current Status

‚úÖ No console errors  
‚úÖ Environment variables correct  
‚úÖ Connected to store: `stx7iu-x1.myshopify.com`  
‚ùå Storefront API returns 0 products  

## Why This Happens

The Shopify **Storefront API** (used by Hydrogen) only shows products that are:
1. ‚úÖ Published
2. ‚úÖ Available for sale
3. ‚úÖ **Published to the correct sales channel**

Your products might exist in Shopify admin but not be visible to the Storefront API.

## Verify Products Are Published

After publishing products, verify they're visible to the API:

```bash
# Run this in terminal to check:
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://stx7iu-x1.myshopify.com/api/2024-10/graphql.json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token: 82c7d1f918a145e14dede6b2d4b22da2" \
  -d '{"query":"{ products(first: 5) { nodes { id title } } }"}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

If you see products listed, refresh your dev site!

## About Sales Channels

### What is a Sales Channel?
- A place where your products can be sold
- Examples: Online Store, Hydrogen storefront, Mobile app, etc.

### Why Does This Matter?
- Products must be published to a channel to be visible there
- Your Hydrogen storefront is a separate channel from your Online Store
- Products published to "Online Store" won't automatically show in Hydrogen

### How to Check Your Hydrogen Channel

1. Go to: https://admin.shopify.com/store/stx7iu-x1/settings/channels
2. Look for "Headless" or "Sacred Line Studio"
3. This is your Hydrogen sales channel

### Scenario 3: Printful Products Not Syncing
**Fix:**
