# ‚úÖ Issues Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. CSS Import Warning ‚úÖ
**Problem**: PostCSS warning about `@import` not being first
```
@import must precede all other statements (besides @charset or empty @layer)
```

**Solution**: Moved the Google Fonts `@import` to the very top of `app/styles/app.css`

**Before**:
```css
:root {
  /* variables... */
}

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/...');
```

**After**:
```css
/* Import Google Fonts - Must be first */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/...');

:root {
  /* variables... */
}
```

### 2. Homepage Data Loading ‚úÖ
**Status**: Working correctly!

The console showed:
```
Homepage rendering with data: Object {
  featuredProducts: Promise,
  featuredCollection: Object,
  collections: Array(1)
}
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ Homepage is rendering
- ‚úÖ Featured collection is loading (Object)
- ‚úÖ Collections are loading (1 collection found)
- ‚úÖ Products are loading asynchronously (Promise)

## About the "Redirect" Issue

Based on the logs, the homepage IS loading successfully (status 200). If you're seeing a redirect, it's likely one of these:

### Possibility 1: Navigation Menu
Your Shopify menu has a "Home" link to `/collections/frontpage`. When you click that menu item, it goes there instead of `/`.

**Solution**: 
- Click on **"Sacred Line Studio"** (the store name) instead of "Home" in the menu
- Or manually type `/` in the URL bar
- Or fix the menu in Shopify Admin

### Possibility 2: Browser Behavior
If the page loads then quickly changes, it might be:
- Browser back/forward cache
- React Router prefetching
- Hydration mismatch (unlikely based on logs)

### Possibility 3: No Actual Redirect
The data shows the page is rendering successfully. If you're on `/` and seeing content, there's no redirect happening!

---

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear browser cache**: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. **Go to**: http://localhost:3001/
3. **Check URL bar**: Should stay at `/` 
4. **Scroll down**: Should see all 7 sections
5. **Open DevTools** (F12): Should see no errors

## Next Steps

### If Homepage Works Now ‚úÖ
Great! You can now:
1. Publish your 3 products to the Hydrogen channel (see PUBLISH_YOUR_3_PRODUCTS.md)
2. Customize the hero section content
3. Update the brand story text
4. Add more products

### If You Still See Issues ‚ùå
Please let me know:
1. What URL is in the address bar?
2. What do you see on the page?
3. Are there any errors in the browser console (F12)?
4. Does the URL change when you load the page?

## Files Modified

‚úÖ `app/styles/app.css` - Moved @import to top
‚úÖ `app/routes/_index.tsx` - Removed debug console.log, added null safety
